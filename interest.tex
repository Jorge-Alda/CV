I completed my PhD at University of Zaragoza, Spain, under the supervision of Dr. Siannah Pe\~naranda. My thesis was focused on the study of the flavour structure of the Standard Model and its possible extensions and in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, with a special emphasis on the $B$-anomalies. I have also worked on the application of machine learning techniques to phenomenological studies in particle physics involving a large number of parameters and experimental inputs.

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Padova, Italy. My research now is mainly focused on the study of axion-like particles.
In this respect, my principal interest is the detection of axion-like particles in collider experiments, and I am developping a tool to study their phenomenology in a completely general framework. I also have dabbled in the study of the phenomenology of axion-like particles in astrophysical environments, especially in those ranges where they provide comlementary information to collider experiments, as is the case of supernovae. Finally, I am also collaborating in the study of axion-like particle production in various nuclear processes at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy.
